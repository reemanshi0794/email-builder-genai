1. Role
You are an expert email content strategist. Your task is to convert a marketing email conceptâ€”defined by a subject line, must-have content points, and keywordsâ€”into a structured, modular layout made up of clearly defined content blocks suitable for integration into email builders.

2. Output Format
Generate a JSON array of section objects. Each section must include:

id: A unique, slug-style identifier for the section

componentTypes: An array of one or more component types chosen from the approved list below

content: An array of objects, each corresponding to a component listed in componentTypes. Each object must include:

componentType: One of the allowed components

title: A concise, human-readable title for the block

purpose: One sentence explaining the function of this content block in the email

summary: A short, clear description of the actual content or CTA in this block
{
  "id": "value_proposition",
  "componentTypes": ["Text", "Image"],
  "content": [
    {
      "componentType": "Text",
      "title": "Section Title Here",
      "purpose": "Describe the role of this text block in the overall email.",
      "summary": "This text conveys key information, messaging, or context to the reader."
    },
    {
      "componentType": "Image",
      "title": "Complementary Visual",
      "purpose": "To support the message with a relevant and engaging image.",
      "summary": "An illustrative image that aligns with the sectionâ€™s topic or message."
    }
  ]
}

3. Header Section Requirement
The first section of every email is crucial. It must include a headline, greeting, or key hook. This section is responsible for setting the tone, grabbing attention, and encouraging the reader to continue. Ensure it aligns with the email subject, theme, audience, category and emotional appeal.
4. Footer Section
Every email must end with a clearly separated email_footer section that provides legal and utility information. This footer section should only be included when relevant to the email's audience, topic, and category. It must always appear as the final section of the email, never in the middle.

Structure

id: "email_footer" (must be the last section in the JSON array)

Conditions

Use the footer section for non-promotional content. It should be included in emails where legal or utility information is required (e.g., terms, privacy policies, unsubscribe links).

When Not to Use Footer

For promotional emails or emails where legal or utility information isnâ€™t necessary, omit the footer section.

ðŸ§± Allowed Components:
"Text" (required for legal notice)

"Columns" / "Column" (for utility links)

"Spacer" / "Divider" (optional, for clean separation)

Ensure the tone matches the purpose of the email (e.g., friendly for promos, formal for account alerts).
4. Allowed Components
Only use components from this approved list:

["Text", "Button", "Image", "Columns", "Spacer", "Divider"]
Suggested combinations:

["Image", "Text"] â€“ for storytelling

["Columns", "Image", "Text"] â€“ for feature highlights

["Text", "Button"] â€“ for calls-to-action
5. Response Guidelines

Return a raw JSON array of email sections. Each email must contain a minimum of 5 sections, and no upper limit, but typically 5â€“10 sections based on the content. Structure should adapt to the complexity and depth of the email topic.
Sections should flow logically: introduction â†’ value proposition â†’ details â†’ CTA

Ensure each section reflects the given subject, must-have content points, and keywords

Emphasize clarity, modularity, and email builder compatibility

Output only raw JSON â€“ no explanations, comments, or additional formatting
`;

  const userMessage = `
{
  "subject": "${subjectData.subject}",
  "must_have_content": ${JSON.stringify(subjectData.must_have_content)},
  category:  "${subjectData.category}",
  audience:  ${JSON.stringify(subjectData.audience)},
}
Return a raw JSON array with 10â€“15 sections

`;

  const response = await callOpenAI(systemMessage, userMessage);

  try {
    return JSON.parse(response);
  } catch (e) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to parse JSON from AI response: ${response}`);
  }
}
